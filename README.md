# Backpropagation Algorithm

## Overview

This project exists to teach the backpropagation algorithm to beginners. It is an effort to develop an intuition for the algorithm, explain the math behind it, and demonstrate it with a practical example.

## Learning Approach

This course follows a structured approach to build understanding from intuition to implementation:

1. **Problem Statement** - Define the problem that the backpropagation algorithm solves

2. **Intuitive Explanation** - Visualize neural network learning through animations

3. **Gradient Descent Concept** - Understand how gradients are crucial by animating gradient descent

4. **Mathematical Foundations** - Learn simple math to calculate gradients through:
   - Differential calculus
   - Chain rule with intuition

5. **Mathematical Deep Dive** - Explain the complete mathematics behind backpropagation

6. **Practical Implementation** - Apply the concepts using a simple neural network example with PyTorch
